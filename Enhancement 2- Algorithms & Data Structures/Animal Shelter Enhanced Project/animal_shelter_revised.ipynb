    "# EJG Animal Shelter Dashboard Application - Enhanced Version\n",
    "# Author: Edward Garcia\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview:\n",
    "# This is an enhanced version of my Animal Shelter Dashboard, originally developed for my CS340 course.\n",
    "# My enhancements aim to improve user experience, functionality, and maintainability of the application through enhanced UX/UI design with logging and \n",
    "# testing, optimized data structures and algorithms for searching, caching, and data access. I will also enhance the database aspect of the application \n",
    "# by optimizing user data, passwords, roles, security, and authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enhancement 1- Software Design and Engineering\n",
    "# 1. User Interface and User Experience:\n",
    "#    - Integrated Dash Bootstrap components to provide better styling and responsiveness.\n",
    "#    - Applied the VAPOR Bootstrap theme to create a visually appealing and consistent interface.\n",
    "#    - Improved data presentation by utilizing cards, colors, custom fonts, and shadow effects to headers for a more engaging user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Navigation and Search Functionality:\n",
    "#    - Added a responsive navigation bar with links to the About Us and Contact Us sections, enabling easy navigation that scrolls to the page section.\n",
    "#    - Introduced a search bar in the navigation to filter animal data by breed or name, with modifications to ensure search queries are \n",
    "#      case-insensitive for a more user-friendly experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Data Management Enhancements:\n",
    "#    - Added a \"Refresh Data\" button, allowing users to easily update and view the most current dataset.\n",
    "#    - Added a \"Download Data\" button to provide users with the ability to download the animal dataset as a CSV file directly from the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. User Engagement Features:\n",
    "#    - Included dedicated sections for \"About Us\" and \"Contact Us\" to improve user engagement and provide relevant organizational information.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Logging and Maintainability:\n",
    "#    - Implemented logging to capture and track dashboard activities, which aids in debugging, application monitoring, and maintaining behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Enhancement 2: Data Structures and Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Enhanced flexibility with caching bypass:\n",
    "#    - Introduced a `bypass_cache` parameter in the `read` method to allow direct database queries when live data is required.\n",
    "#    - Incorporated `bypass_cache` into the dashboard callbacks, ensuring accurate results for user interactions like filtering, map updates, and \n",
    "#      downloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Optimized data access:\n",
    "#    - Implemented a hashable query transformation to enable caching for MongoDB queries, so that it is in sync with `lru_cache`.\n",
    "#    - Improved search efficiency in callbacks by applying case-insensitive filters for user search input.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Enhanced search algorithms with testing:\n",
    "#    - Optimized search and filter functions in the dashboard to improve responsiveness, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "#    - Used Python’s efficient data handling techniques like `apply` and `lambda` for real-time filtering.\n",
    "#    - To validate and demonstrate the effectiveness of my enhancements (hash map, LRU caching, binary search),\n",
    "#      I also implemented several tests within the notebook.\n",
