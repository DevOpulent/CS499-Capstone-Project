    components, I developed a responsive interface with features such as a search bar, a "Refresh Data" button, a 
    "Download" button to export database information, and an "About Us" section. These updates foster collaboration and 
    align with Course Outcome 1. The improvements showcased professional-quality design, meeting Course Outcome 2. 
    Implementing unit testing and logging further enhanced reliability and maintainability, satisfying Course Outcome 4. 
    The data validation and error handling implementations demonstrated a strong security mindset for Course Outcome 5.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second enhancement focused on optimizing efficiency and scalability by refining the application‚Äôs algorithms and 
    data structures. I implemented an LRU cache, hash maps, and binary search to enhance query speeds and improve performance. 
    By adding configurable cache sizes, I also verified scalability as the dataset grows. These updates addressed Course Outcome 3, 
    demonstrating my ability to design and evaluate solutions for efficiency challenges. Performance benchmarking and 
    thorough documentation aligned with Course Outcome 4 and Course Outcome 2, emphasizing sound methodologies and effective 
    communication.
  </p>

  <p>
    The third enhancement strengthened database security by introducing advanced authentication mechanisms, including 
    user authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC). I created a login page 
    with fields for username, password, MFA OTP, and added a logout button for secure session management. These enhancements 
    mitigated vulnerabilities using bcrypt password hashing and QR code-based MFA, directly addressing Course Outcome 5. 
    The improvements also fostered a secure and user-friendly environment, supporting Course Outcome 1, while detailed 
    documentation and the use of modern tools highlighted Course Outcome 2 and for Course Outcome 4.

        </a>

<p>
  For Enhancement 3, I focused on improving the application's database security by implementing <em>user authentication</em>, <em>multi-factor authentication (MFA)</em>, and <em>role-based access control (RBAC)</em>. These updates demonstrate my expertise in MongoDB, Python, and secure UI design, making sure the application remains functional, secure, and user-friendly.
</p>

<p>
  To secure the database, I created a <em>"users"</em> collection in MongoDB with bcrypt-hashed passwords, user roles (guest, regular user, or admin), and optional MFA secrets. I implemented <em>QR code-based MFA</em> to allow users to configure authentication apps such as Microsoft Authenticator, and RBAC to restrict access based on user roles. To demonstrate functionality, I created sample users with varying roles and MFA configurations.
</p>

<p>
  On the frontend, I developed a <em>login page</em> with fields for username, password, and MFA OTP, and added a <em>logout button</em> for secure session termination. On the backend, I implemented Python methods to handle user creation, authentication, MFA verification, and role validation. I also enhanced the <em>logging system</em> to track events such as login attempts, role validation, and MFA usage, improving monitoring and troubleshooting.
</p>

<p>
  These enhancements align with key course outcomes. By mitigating vulnerabilities with bcrypt password hashing and QR code-based MFA, I directly addressed <strong>Course Outcome 5</strong>. The secure and user-friendly environment fostered by these updates aligns with <strong>Course Outcome 1</strong>, while the use of detailed documentation and modern tools highlights <strong>Course Outcome 2</strong> and <strong>Course Outcome 4</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Throughout this process, I learned the importance of balancing <em>security</em> and <em>usability</em>, confirming that MFA and RBAC provided robust protection without overcomplicating the user experience. These enhancements showcase my ability to address real-world challenges with innovative, secure solutions.
